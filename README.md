# MP3DataMining
my project was to see if you could predict the outcome of a game essentially before it starts using champion win rates.

In order to run you need to have FullPlayerChampAndWin.txt and champion.json downloaded and in the same directory.
Once you run the program it will ask you to input the id number of a champion on the blue team. Do not put in the name of a champion. 
Use the list it prints out for you to fill out 5 champions for the blue team and 5 for the red team. If you want to see specific
win rates for champions or blue/red side, there is an option to do that after filling out the two teams.
